# How-to: Correlate source data to TDU documents

Use this procedure to link each document in the plan to the source files it relies on. Correlation keeps coverage and traceability reports meaningful.

!!! goal

    Associate each document plan entry with the correct source files from the project source list.

## Before you start

Confirm that you have:

-   Configured the **Central Data Path** and built the source list.
-   Imported or created the document plan.
-   A clear idea which source files support each document.

## Steps

1.  Open the project and go to the **Document Plan** tab.
1.  Locate the document row you want to correlate.
1.  In the **Sources** column for that row, click the link or button, or right click the row and choose **Edit sources**.
1.  In the **Select sources** dialog, review the list of available source files.

    -   Use filters or search to narrow the list by file name or folder if needed.
1.  Select the checkboxes for each source file that contributes to this document.
1.  Click **OK** or **Apply** to save the correlation.
1.  Back in the **Document Plan** tab, confirm that the **Sources** column now shows the updated count or list of linked sources.
1.  Repeat for other documents that need source correlations.

If a required source file does not appear in the list, check that it is present in the central data folder and that the source list has been rebuilt. Then repeat this procedure.

!!! outcome

    Each document plan entry is linked to the relevant source files, and the document plan shows those correlations.
