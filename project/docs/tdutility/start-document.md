# How-to: Start a TDU document from the plan

Use this procedure when you are ready to turn a planned item in the document plan into a working document file. You will create the file from the correct template in the project production folder.

!!! goal

    Create a new working document from a document plan entry in the project’s production folder.

## Before you start

Confirm that you have:

-   Configured the project metadata, including **Production Path** and any required templates.
-   Imported or created the document plan entry you want to start.
-   An assigned author for the document, if your team expects one before work begins.

## Steps

1.  Open the project and go to the **Document Plan** tab.
1.  Locate the row for the document you want to start.

    -   Confirm that the title, type, and any author assignment are correct.
1.  Check the **Status** for the document.

    -   If your team uses a **Planned** status, set the status to **Planned** before you start.
1.  With the document row selected, click **Start document** on the toolbar, or right click the row and choose **Start document from template**.
1.  In the confirmation dialog, review:

    -   The template that will be used.
    -   The destination folder, which should match the **Production Path**.
1.  Click **Create**.
1.  After the operation completes, confirm that:

    -   The document row now shows a **Document Path** or similar field populated.
    -   A new file appears in the production folder with the expected name.
1.  To begin writing, double click the row or use **Open document** to open the file in your authoring tool.

If you see an error about the production folder or missing templates, cancel the operation, fix the project metadata or template configuration, then repeat these steps.

!!! outcome

    The selected document plan entry now has a corresponding working file in the production folder, created from the agreed template.
