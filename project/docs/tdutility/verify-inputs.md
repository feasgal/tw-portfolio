# How-to: Verify TDU reporting inputs

Use this procedure to confirm that a TDU project is ready for reporting. You will check metadata, the source list, and the document plan for obvious issues before stakeholders start using reports.

!!! goal

    Confirm that the core inputs for reporting are present and consistent.

## Before you start

Confirm that you have:

-   Completed metadata configuration.
-   Built the source list at least once.
-   Imported or created an initial document plan.

## Steps

1.  In the **Metadata** tab, confirm that required fields are populated, especially:

    -   **Master Record ID**
    -   **Central Data Path**
    -   **Production Path**
1.  In the **Sources** tab, confirm that a source list exists.

    -   Spot-check that the files listed match the cleaned source files for the agreed project scope.
1.  In the **Document Plan** tab, spot-check several entries:

    -   Each document has the correct type and status.
    -   Author assignments use the correct `firstname.lastname` identifiers.
1.  If you see problems, fix them now:

    -   Update metadata values and save the project.
    -   Refresh the source list if files or paths changed.
    -   Correct document plan entries and save again.

!!! outcome

    The project metadata, source list, and document plan are aligned and current, so TDU reports can represent the project accurately.
