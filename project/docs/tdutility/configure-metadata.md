# How-to: Configure TDU project metadata

Use this procedure after you open a TDU project. You will connect the project to the correct master record and working folders so documents and reports line up with your real project.

Get the official Master Record ID for this project, and the network paths for both the source files and the production document output.

## Steps

1.  In your open project, go to the **Metadata** tab.
1.  In **Master Record ID**, enter the official ID from your project-tracking system.
    
    !!! tip
    
        If you are not sure which ID to use, pause here and confirm it. Reports roll up to this record.

        If multiple projects share a data location, confirm that you are using the correct folder for this project before saving.

    In **Sources**, enter or browse to the folder that holds the source files for this project.

1.  In **Documents**, enter or browse to the project’s documents folder.
    -   TDU creates documents here by copying and renaming the appropriate templates.
1.  Save the project.

!!! outcome

    The project metadata is saved. The master record and all working paths point to the correct locations for this project.
