# How-to: Add authors to a TDU project

Use this procedure to add the authors who will work on a TDU project. This controls which names you can assign documents to in the document plan.

!!! goal

     Maintain an accurate list of authors for the project using consistent identifiers.

## Before you start

Confirm that you have:

-   A list of authors assigned to the project.
-   Each author’s identifier in `firstname.lastname` format.

## Steps

1.  Open the project and go to the **Metadata** tab.
1.  Locate the **Author** field list.
1.  For each author assigned to the project, add a new **Author** entry.
1.  For each entry, enter the identifier in `firstname.lastname` format.
1.  Review the list and remove any duplicates or outdated entries.
1.  Save the project.

Note: Use the same identifier format that appears in your other systems so you can match reporting later without clean-up work.

!!! outcome

     The project has a clean author list made up of current team members, using consistent identifiers.
