# How-to: Open or create a TDU project

Use this procedure when you need to start work on a real project in Tech Doc Utility (TDU). You will either open a shell project that exists already or create a new one so you can configure it.

!!! goal

    Open a TDU project in its own tab so you can configure metadata, authors, sources, and the document plan.

## Before you start

Make sure TDU is visible in the Acme system tray, and get the project name your team expects you to use.

## Steps

1.  Launch **TDU** from the Acme system tray.
1.  On the startup page, do one of the following:

    -   To start a new project, click **New project** and enter a clear project name.
    -   To use a shell project, select it from the list and click **Open**.
   
1.  Confirm that the project opens in its own tab.
1.  Check the project name in the tab header. Make sure it matches the project you intend to configure.

!!! outcome

    You have a TDU project open in its own tab and are ready to configure it.
