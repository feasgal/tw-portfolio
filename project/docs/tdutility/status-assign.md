# How-to: Change status and assign TDU documents

Use this procedure to keep document status and ownership current in the document plan. Accurate status and assignments keep reporting and work queues reliable.

!!! goal

    Update document statuses and author assignments in the document plan so they match current work.

## Before you start

Confirm that you have:

-   A current document plan for the project.
-   The list of authors who should own each document, with their `firstname.lastname` identifiers.
-   Agreement on the status values your team uses, such as **Planned**, **In progress**, **Review**, **Approved**.

## Steps

### Update a single document

1.  Open the project and go to the **Document Plan** tab.
1.  Locate the document row you want to update.
1.  To change status, click in the **Status** cell and select the new status from the drop down list.
1.  To change the assigned author, click in the **Author** cell and select the correct `firstname.lastname` from the list.
1.  Confirm that the row now shows the expected status and author.
1.  Save the project.

### Update several documents at once

1.  In the **Document Plan** tab, select all rows you want to update.
1.  To bulk change status, use **Set status** on the toolbar or context menu and choose the new status.
1.  To bulk assign an author, use **Assign author** and choose the correct `firstname.lastname`.
1.  Spot check a few rows to make sure the changes applied as expected.
1.  Save the project.

If you cannot change a status, for example from **Approved** back to **In progress**, your project may restrict that transition. In that case, follow your team’s escalation process or ask your project lead to update the status.

!!! outcome

    Document plan entries show up to date statuses and author assignments that match the actual work.
