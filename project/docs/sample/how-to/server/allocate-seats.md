# Allocate seats to a USB on the server

To share licenses across a network, seats must be activated to the **Acme dongle** attached to the server host. This places the entitlements where the server can grant leases to clients.

!!! goal

    Activate a license to the Acme dongle on the server host so clients can lease seats over the network.

## Before you start

On the server host, connect an Acme dongle directly to a USB port (avoid multiport USB adapters). Open **Acme License Hub** and sign in with the account that holds the license.

## Steps

1. In **Acme License Hub**, find the license under **Available**.
2. Choose **Activate** and select the **Acme dongle** as the target.

!!! outcome

    The license appears on the server’s Acme dongle and is available for clients to lease via the server.
