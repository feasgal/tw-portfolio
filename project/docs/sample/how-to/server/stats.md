# View server statistics

Use Server Admin to see who is connected, which products are in use, and where clients are being denied. This helps with capacity planning, auditing, and resolving "can’t get a seat" reports.

!!! goal

    Monitor leases, clients, and license usage to spot peaks and denials.

## Before you start

Sign in to **Server Admin** with administrator rights. If you’re investigating a complaint, note the approximate time and product involved so you can focus your review.

## Steps

1.   Open **Server Admin**.
1.   Go to **Statistics** or **Status**.
1.   Review the key indicators:

     - **Online/Offline** state of the server
     - **Active clients** currently connected
     - **Active leases** and recent **lease history/denials**
     - **License usage by product** (peaks and trends)

!!! outcome

    You can identify peak usage periods, see which products consume seats, and pinpoint blocked clients or denials.
