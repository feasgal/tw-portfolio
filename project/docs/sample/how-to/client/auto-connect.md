# Auto-connect to a public server

If your server advertises on the LAN, you can connect with a couple of clicks. This is the fastest path for workstations on the same subnet or broadcast domain.

!!! goal

    Connect to a publicly discoverable server using the Hub’s **Discovered** list.

## Before you start

Join the same subnet/VLAN as the server and get the access password from your administrator if required. If you’re remote or on a different subnet, use a private connection method instead.

## Steps

1. Open **Acme License Hub** and go to **Servers**.
1. Under **Discovered**, select your server.
1. Click **Connect** and provide the access password if prompted.

!!! outcome

    The server shows **Connected** in the Hub and you can launch apps without licensing errors.
