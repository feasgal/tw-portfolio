# Activate a license

To run a protected app, move the license from your account to an **Acme dongle** or **Acme Cloud** session.

This guide is for activating a license for local use. To serve shared licenses over a network, see [Allocate seats to a USB on the server](/sample/how-to/server/allocate-seats.md). No activation is required at the client machine, but it must be [connected to the server host](/sample/tutorials/connect-private-client.md).

!!! goal

## Before you start

Sign in to **Acme License Hub**. Decide where you want the license to live: an **Acme dongle** (connect it directly to a USB port) or **Acme Cloud** session (ensure internet access).

1. Click **Activate**.
1. Choose a location: **Acme dongle** or **Acme Cloud** session (if supported).
1. Confirm and wait for activation to complete.
