# Repair an Acme dongle

Fix common issues with the USB key before filing a replacement claim.

!!! goal

    Resolve typical dongle errors by synchronizing and reinitializing connections.

## Before you start

Connect the **Acme dongle** directly to the computer (avoid multiport USB adapters). Open **Acme License Hub** and sign in.

## Steps

1. In the Hub, right-click the dongle and choose **Synchronize**.
2. If the issue persists, move the dongle to a different USB port and repeat **Synchronize**.
3. If still failing, try another machine to rule out local USB issues.
4. If the dongle is not detected at all, reseat it and check OS-level USB/device settings.

!!! outcome

    Most state or connection issues clear after a successful synchronization or port change; the dongle and licenses appear correctly in the Hub.
