# App version unsupported

A protected app can't use sharable licenses due to version limits.

## Confirm

-   The vendor's release notes list support for sharable licenses.
-   The app version on the client matches or exceeds the minimum.

## Likely causes and fixes

1.   **Old app build**  
   Update the app to a version that supports sharable licenses.
1.   **Mixed plugin versions**  
   Update all related plugins to compatible builds.
1.   **Runtime mismatch**  
   Reinstall Acme License Engine on the client.
