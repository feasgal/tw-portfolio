# Introduction

Welcome to my technical writing portfolio. This portfolio has two independent parts: a single-page case study and a small example docs set for a fictional license manager app. The case study tells a delivery story. The example docs show my information architecture and writing.

## What’s inside

-   **Case study**
    
    A concise narrative of the starting problem, tooling decisions, architecture, and outcomes. It focuses on why I made each choice and what it enabled.

-   **Example docs set**

    Diátaxis-based docs for a fictional licensing platform. I produced a complete Markdown set organized into Tutorials, How-to, Reference, Explanation, and Troubleshooting, with a Getting started portal to help a new user find their way to the information they need for a quick first success. Built with MkDocs Material, with reusable templates and style rules. Result: fast findability, clean navigation, and a structure that would scale.


## How to read

1.   Start with the case study to understand my approach to diagnosing problems and shipping a docs program.
1.   Browse the example docs to see structure, page types, and copy you could drop into a real product.

## Notes

-   Neutral placeholders have replaced proprietary names and details.
-   The example docs exist only to illustrate IA and voice; they're independent of the case study.

## Confidentiality

I have replaced any internal identifiers, proprietary assets, and confidential references with *[neutral placeholders]*. I intend this portfolio solely to show documentation strategy and systems, not internal technologies or business practices. Each document has undergone a thorough review and sanitizing process to ensure full compliance with all nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality obligations.
