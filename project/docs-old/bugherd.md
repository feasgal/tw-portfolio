## Overview

!!! warning inline end

	Only the text of the BugHerd cards, not the HTML of the docs themselves, goes to the BugHerd servers.
	This is low-risk, because trade secrets/design discussion don't really happen in docs feedback.
	However, be circumspect in how deep of design information you include in comments.
	A good general rule is that if you would say it on Slack, you can say it in a BugHerd card.

We use BugHerd to collect internal requests for changes.
If you're logged into BugHerd with access to the relevant project, and you have the BugHerd browser extension installed and active, then when you view the corresponding docs, you will see a sidebar that lets you add comments directly on the site.

This is how, for example, *[ACME Corp's]* end-user support team requests a new FAQ entry be added to the End-User Help.

Click the relevant links below to join a BugHerd project as a Guest.
You will be prompted to install the BugHerd browser extension if you don't already have it.
When you make your first comment, you will be prompted for your e-mail address, which is used to create a Guest account for you in the background if you don't already have one.
Go ahead and use your company address; that way if we ever need to promote you to a paid member on our BugHerd account, it should be seamless.

Here's an [interactive how-to from BugHerd](https://app.storylane.io/demo/jhqmlnervomp). Just click the green dot to follow a 'tour' of sorts.
